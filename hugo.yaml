        content: |-
            I'm currently a CompE @ Purdue, graduating May 2026! In my remaining two semesters at Purdue, 
            I'm looking to learn more about how computers work, including Computer Architecture, OS, Compilers, 
            and more. I'm also interested in AI/ML, and I'm looking to learn more about model architecture, Computer Vision, and NLP.

            Professionally, I have experience in AI/ML, Data Science, and PCB design. I've worked on projects
            like LLM architectures, Computer Vision models, and sales strategy prediction models.

            I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and nothing excites me more than a new challenge.
